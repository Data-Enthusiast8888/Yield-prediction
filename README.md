# 🌾 Yield-prediction

**Predict smarter. Communicate clearer. Empower agriculture.**  
A modular machine learning system designed to forecast crop yields with emotional clarity and technical precision.

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This repo blends engineering and design to deliver:
- 🧠 **Robust yield modeling** with testable credibility metrics
- 🔌 **FastAPI endpoints** for smooth backend predictions
- 🎨 **Emotion-centered UI** via Streamlit or React for human feedback
- 🐳 **Dockerized orchestration** for reproducible deployment across environments

## 📁 Repository Structure  
| Folder/File          | Description                                            |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `Training/`          | Model training scripts and preprocessing pipelines     |
| `api/`               | FastAPI backend serving predictions                    |
| `frontend/`          | Interactive UI with feedback layers                    |
| `docker-compose.yml` | Unified environment scaffolding for multi-module flow |

## 🚀 Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- Docker & Docker Compose  
- Python ≥ 3.8  
- Streamlit
  

### Run locally  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Data-Enthusiast8888/Yield-prediction.git
cd Yield-prediction
docker-compose up --build
```

Access the frontend via [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

## 🧪 How It Works  
1. Upload input data via the interface  
2. Backend routes compute predictions and return results  
3. UI renders yield forecasts with emotional resonance and clarity

## ✨ Roadmap  
- ✅ Initial commit and Dockerized scaffolding  
- 🔄 Add ensemble model comparison and credibility tests  
- 🎨 Refine UI overlays for feedback and trust signals  
- 📊 Publish README carousel on emotionally resonant ML  
- 🌍 Add Swahili/localized version for wider outreach
